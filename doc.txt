Proxy-project
doc.txt

	This proxy executable generated by the source code
in this project is meant to act a middleman between a web client
and a web server.  The app borrows heavily from the source code
provided in the course textbook.  

	Besides forwarding requests and responses between the 
client and the remote web server, this proxy server checks an
incoming HTTP response for a set of disallowed words.  If a 
disallowed word is detected within the response, the page is 
blocked and replaced by a web page issued from the proxy.

	The search for disallowed words uses a very basic algorithm.
  Essentially, the words are read in from the DisallowedWords file into
an array.  For each disallowed word in the array, the content of the response
buffer are compared using the cstdio library's strstr function.
