Known Shortcomings
==================

Fails to receive the body of POST requests sent through Firefox (works in telnet).

Fails to timeout on certain requests made by browser to auxillary sites.
For example requests to: http://safebrowsing.google.com...
tend to hang and fail.

Fails, at times, to detect the end of javascript source files that are requested as an asset
for web pages with dynamic content.
